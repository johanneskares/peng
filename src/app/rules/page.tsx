        <h1>Peng Game Rules</h1>

        <p>
          Welcome to Peng! The ultimate game of paranoia, betrayal, and the
          occasional awkward bathroom encounter. Get ready to sharpen your sins,
          dodge imaginary bullets, and keep one eye over your shoulder at all
          times. Here&apos;s everything you need to survive and maybe win this
          battle royal.
        </p>

        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Gather a group of 4 to 20+ players.</li>
          <li>
            Everyone needs a smartphone to access penggame.com, where
            you&apos;ll track the massacre.
          </li>
          <li>
            Choose a Game Master, whose sole job is to name and start the game
            on the platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wait for the game master to send you a link to enter your email
            addresses.
          </li>
          <li>
            When everyone has entered their name & e-mail the Game Master can
            start the game.
          </li>
          <li>
            Everyone will receive an email with the name of the first target.
          </li>
          <li>
            Optional: grab one piece of paper and a pen to write down your
            initial target you&apos;ll receive via email (you can also just use
            the email)
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <h3>The Assignment</h3>
        <p>
          At the start of the round, the Game Master starts the game on the
          platform and each player receives a secret target via email. Keep it
          confidential—no spoilers—this is an assassination, not a gossip
          session. Optional: Write their name on a small piece of paper, fold
          it, and keep it hidden.
        </p>

        <h3>The Objective</h3>
        <p>
          &quot;Peng&quot; (eliminate) your target before someone else
          &quot;pengs&quot; you. Think of it as survival of the sneakiest.
        </p>

        <h3>The Art of the Peng</h3>
        <h4>Find Your Moment:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To take down your target, you must be completely alone with them in
            a fully enclosed space (a room, bathroom, car, tent, etc.).
          </li>
          <li>
            All doors and windows must be closed and no other people may be
            present in the space (Note: a bathroom stall with small gaps at the
            top or bottom qualifies as enclosed if the door and window are
            closed.)
          </li>
          <li>
            If someone spies the action through a closed window, that&apos;s
            fine—as long as they don&apos;t intervene or open a door or window.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Make the Kill:</h4>
        <p>
          Point your index & middle fingers like a pistol at your target and
          confidently say, &quot;PENG!&quot; Bonus points for style &
          creativity.
        </p>

        <h4>If You Succeed:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Your target is eliminated. (Cue dramatic exit music.)</li>
          <li>
            They must hand over their target to you (you will also get it via
            email as soon as you log the kill). You&apos;re now carrying on
            their legacy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Log your kill via the email you received from penggame.com so
            everyone knows who&apos;s still standing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Want to brag? Take a photo of the glorious moment and share it with
            your group of friends (optional but highly encouraged).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>If You&apos;re Penged:</h4>
        <p>
          You&apos;re eliminated and out. Join the sidelines, cheer on your
          executioner, and plan your revenge for the next round.
        </p>

        <h2>Special Rules</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Safe Zones: Agree on areas where &quot;penging&quot; is off-limits
            (e.g., workplaces, bedrooms, or nursing homes).
          </li>
          <li>
            Safe Times: Set time windows when no &quot;penging&quot; can occur
            (e.g., 10:00 PM to 8:00 AM). Even assassins need to sleep.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Time Limit</h2>
        <p>
          There isn&apos;t one. A round can last days, weeks, or even months,
          depending on how sneaky (or lazy) everyone is. The Game Master can
          declare a winner if it drags on too long or you want to start another
          round with a similar group.
        </p>

        <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
        <p>
          The last surviving player wins eternal glory—or at least some bragging
          rights. Additional awards can add to the fun:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Lord of the Peng: The ultimate survivor and glorious assassin.
          </li>
          <li>
            First Blood: For the first successful &quot;peng.&quot; Ruthless and
            efficient.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serial Killer: For the player with the most eliminations - truly
            bloodthirsty and a true slaughterer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Secret Agent: The stealthiest player who got at least one super
            sneaky kill - a true James Bond.
          </li>
          <li>
            Banana Death: For the most ridiculous or embarrassing elimination
            (the victim may get blessed by the Cult of the Banana one day).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Important Reminders</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Safety First: No running, jumping out of windows, or doing anything
            stupid to achieve or avoid a &quot;peng.&quot; Keep it fun, not
            dangerous.
          </li>
          <li>
            Respect Boundaries: Don&apos;t invade personal space, cross lines,
            or ruin friendships. This is a game and ensure all players feel
            comfortable participating.
          </li>
          <li>
            No Real Weapons: Terms like &quot;gun,&quot; &quot;peng,&quot;
            &quot;kill,&quot; and &quot;weapon&quot; are used only in the
            playful context of this game - so imaginary guns only. If you think
            a real weapon is a good idea, you&apos;re playing the wrong game (or
            need new hobbies). Be peaceful and kind—this is a game of fun, not
            force.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep It Light: Ensure no one gets hurt physically or emotionally,
            and no one feels intimidated or uncomfortable. The goal is laughter,
            not tears. If someone feels uncomfortable, respect their limits and
            adjust. Never use violence to achieve a &quot;peng.&quot;
          </li>
          <li>
            Have Fun: This game is about shared chaos, funny moments, and
            lasting memories. Don&apos;t take it too seriously—it&apos;s all
            pretend, after all.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Now that you know the rules... Sharpen your pistols, lock the door of
          your bathroom, trust no one, and let the Peng games begin! May the
          sneakiest, smartest, and cold blooded pengor claim the crown.
